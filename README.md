## Introduction
  In this project, we present a time series model for forecasting the future values of a target variable. The model takes into account the past values of the target variable and any relevant exogenous variables that may influence the target. The purpose of the model is to provide a useful tool for making accurate and informed predictions about the future behavior of the target variable.
