Time Series Model for Forecasting

## Introduction
  In this project, we present a time series model for forecasting the future values of a target variable. The model takes into account the past values of the target variable and any relevant exogenous variables that may influence the target. The purpose of the model is to provide a useful tool for making accurate and informed predictions about the future behavior of the target variable.

## Methodology
  The time series model is built using [insert model type, e.g. ARIMA, SARIMA, LSTM, etc.]. The model is fit using historical data for the target variable and any relevant exogenous variables. The model parameters are estimated using [insert optimization method, e.g. maximum likelihood, gradient descent, etc.].

The diagram above provides a visual representation of the model components and how they interact to produce predictions.

## Evaluation
The performance of the model is evaluated using various metrics, including [insert metrics, e.g. mean absolute error, root mean squared error, etc.]. The model is compared against [insert comparison method, e.g. a baseline model, the actual data, etc.] to assess its accuracy and usefulness in real-world applications.

## Results
The results of the model evaluation indicate that the time series model provides [insert results, e.g. accurate, reliable, etc.] predictions of the future values of the target variable. The model outperforms the [insert comparison method] in terms of [insert metric].

## Conclusion
In conclusion, the time series model provides a useful tool for making accurate and informed predictions about the future behavior of a target variable. The model is shown to be [insert results] and provides valuable insights into the future trends of the targe
